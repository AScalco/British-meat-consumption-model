# An agent-based model to simulate meat consumption behaviour of consumers in Britain 


The current rate of production and consumption of meat poses a problem both to peoples’ health and to the environment. This work aims to develop **a simulation of peoples’ meat consumption behaviour in Britain using agent-based modelling. The agents represent individual **consumers**. The key variables that characterise agents include sex, age, monthly income, perception of the living cost, and concerns about the impact of meat on the environment, health, and animal welfare. A process of **peer influence** is modelled with respect to the agents’ concerns. Influence spreads across two eating networks (i.e. co-workers and household members) depending on the time of day, day of the week, and agents’ employment status. Data from a representative sample of British consumers is used to **empirically ground** the model. Different experiments are run simulating interventions of application of **social marketing campaigns** and a rise in price of meat. The main outcome is the **average weekly consumption of meat per consumer**. A secondary outcome is the likelihood of eating meat.
